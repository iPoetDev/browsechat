Feature: Command Integration with VSCode, UI, Data Model and Navigation
    As a chat browser extension
    I want to ensure proper integration between Commands and other components
    So that user actions are properly handled and executed

    Background: Command Integration Setup
        Given the VSCode extension context is initialized
        And the command manager is registered
        And the data model is ready
        And the UI components are loaded

    Scenario: Open Chat Browser Command Integration
        Given a valid chat file exists in the workspace
        When the open chat browser command is triggered
        Then the webview should be created
        And the chat data should be loaded in the model
        And the navigation state should be initialized
        And the tree view should be updated

    Scenario: Search Chats Command Integration
        Given multiple chat files exist in the workspace
        When the search command is executed with "test query"
        Then the search manager should process the query
        And matching results should be displayed in the UI
        And the navigation should update to the search results
        And the tree view should highlight matched items

    Scenario: Export Chat Command Integration
        Given a chat sequence is selected in the UI
        When the export command is triggered
        Then the data model should prepare the chat data
        And the file system should create an export file
        And the UI should show export progress
        And success notification should be shown

    Scenario: Jump To Chat Command Integration
        Given multiple chat sequences are loaded
        When the jump to chat command is triggered with a specific ID
        Then the navigation manager should locate the chat
        And the UI should scroll to the target chat
        And the tree view should select the target item
        And the webview should highlight the target segment

    Scenario: Filter Command Integration
        Given chat data is displayed in the webview
        When the filter command is executed with criteria
        Then the data model should apply the filter
        And the UI should update to show filtered results
        And the navigation state should preserve filter context
        And the tree view should reflect filtered state

    Scenario: Command Error Handling Integration
        Given a command execution environment
        When a command fails during execution
        Then appropriate error messages should be shown
        And the UI should remain in a consistent state
        And the data model should not be corrupted
        And error telemetry should be logged

    Scenario: Command State Synchronization
        Given multiple VSCode windows are open
        When commands modify the extension state
        Then all windows should reflect the changes
        And the data model should maintain consistency
        And the UI should update across windows
        And the navigation state should be synchronized

    Scenario: Command Integration with Settings
        Given user settings are configured
        When commands are executed with custom settings
        Then the command behavior should respect settings
        And the UI should reflect configured preferences
        And the data model should apply setting constraints
        And settings should persist across sessions
