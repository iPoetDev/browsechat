Feature: Models Component Integration
    As a chat browser extension
    I want to ensure proper integration between all Models components
    So that chat data is properly managed and maintained

    Background:
        Given the data model manager is initialized
        And the chat metadata system is ready
        And the event system is configured

    Scenario: Create and manage chat sequences
        Given a new chat sequence is created
        When multiple chat segments are added to the sequence
        Then the sequence should maintain correct order
        And the sequence should emit appropriate events
        And the sequence metadata should be updated

    Scenario: Handle chat segment operations
        Given existing chat segments in the model
        When a segment is updated with new content
        Then the segment should maintain its metadata
        And related sequences should be updated
        And change events should be emitted

    Scenario: Manage chat metadata across components
        Given chat segments with associated metadata
        When metadata is updated for a segment
        Then all related components should reflect the changes
        And the data model should maintain consistency
        And metadata events should be triggered

    Scenario: Handle event propagation
        Given multiple subscribers to model events
        When a model change occurs
        Then all subscribers should be notified
        And events should be delivered in correct order
        And event payloads should be complete

    Scenario: Data model state management
        Given the data model has multiple chat sequences
        When state changes are triggered
        Then the model should maintain ACID properties
        And concurrent operations should be handled safely
        And the model should prevent data corruption

    Scenario: Type validation and enforcement
        Given chat data with various types
        When data transformations occur
        Then type safety should be maintained
        And invalid data should be rejected
        And type errors should be properly reported

    Scenario: Handle model persistence
        Given chat data in the model
        When persistence operations are triggered
        Then data should be properly serialized
        And data should be retrievable after restart
        And persistence should handle large datasets
