Feature: UI Integration with VSCode API and Services
    As a chat browser extension
    I want to ensure proper integration between UI components and VSCode
    So that users have a seamless chat browsing experience

    Background:
        Given the VSCode extension context is initialized
        And the webview provider is registered
        And the treeview provider is registered
        And the data model is ready
        And the event system is configured

    Scenario: WebView Integration with VSCode
        Given the chat browser webview is created
        When the webview is initialized
        Then the webview should register message handlers
        And the webview should load custom styles
        And the webview should handle VSCode theme changes
        And the webview should maintain state on reload

    Scenario: TreeView Integration with VSCode
        Given the chat browser treeview is created
        When chat data is loaded
        Then the treeview should display chat hierarchy
        And the treeview should handle selection events
        And the treeview should update on data changes
        And the treeview should preserve expansion state

    Scenario: UI Integration with Data Model
        Given chat data exists in the model
        When the UI components are refreshed
        Then the webview should display chat content
        And the treeview should reflect chat structure
        And UI components should stay in sync
        And changes should be reflected immediately

    Scenario: UI Event System Integration
        Given multiple UI subscribers are registered
        When a UI event is triggered
        Then all subscribers should be notified
        And event order should be maintained
        And UI state should be consistent
        And VSCode components should be updated

    Scenario: UI Navigation Integration
        Given multiple chat sequences are loaded
        When navigation events occur
        Then the webview should scroll to target
        And the treeview should highlight correct item
        And the navigation state should be preserved
        And the URL should be updated

    Scenario: UI Search Integration
        Given the search interface is active
        When a search query is executed
        Then results should be highlighted in webview
        And matching items should be marked in treeview
        And result navigation should be enabled
        And search state should persist

    Scenario: UI Theme Integration
        Given different VSCode themes are available
        When the VSCode theme changes
        Then the webview should update styles
        And the treeview should update colors
        And custom UI elements should adapt
        And theme preferences should be saved

    Scenario: UI State Persistence
        Given UI components have custom states
        When the extension is deactivated
        Then component states should be saved
        And states should restore on reactivation
        And user preferences should be preserved
        And view positions should be remembered

    Scenario: UI Error Handling
        Given UI components are functioning
        When an error occurs in any component
        Then error should be displayed appropriately
        And UI should remain responsive
        And error state should be recoverable
        And error details should be logged
