Feature: Parser Integration with File System
    As a chat browser extension
    I want to ensure proper integration between Parser and File System
    So that chat logs are properly read and processed asynchronously

    Background:
        Given the file system is accessible
        And the parser is initialized
        And the metadata extractor is ready
        And temporary test directories are created

    Scenario: Basic File Reading Integration
        Given a valid chat log file exists
        When the parser reads the file
        Then the file should be read asynchronously
        And the content should be parsed into segments
        And file handles should be properly closed
        And system resources should be released

    Scenario: Large File Handling Integration
        Given a chat log file larger than 50MB exists
        When the parser processes the large file
        Then the file should be read in chunks
        And memory usage should be monitored
        And parsing should not block the event loop
        And progress events should be emitted

    Scenario: Multiple File Processing Integration
        Given multiple chat log files exist
        When the parser processes files concurrently
        Then files should be read in parallel
        And system resources should be managed
        And results should maintain file order
        And parsing events should be coordinated

    Scenario: File System Error Handling
        Given various file system scenarios
        When file system errors occur
        Then appropriate errors should be caught
        And error details should be logged
        And resources should be cleaned up
        And error events should be emitted

    Scenario: File Change Monitoring Integration
        Given chat log files are being monitored
        When file changes are detected
        Then change events should be emitted
        And modified files should be reparsed
        And cached data should be updated
        And watchers should be properly managed

    Scenario: File Access Permission Integration
        Given files with different permissions exist
        When the parser attempts to access files
        Then permission checks should occur
        And access errors should be handled
        And appropriate feedback should be given
        And secure operations should be maintained

    Scenario: Metadata Extraction Integration
        Given files contain embedded metadata
        When the metadata extractor processes files
        Then metadata should be extracted asynchronously
        And file operations should be optimized
        And metadata cache should be updated
        And extraction events should be emitted

    Scenario: File System Event Integration
        Given file system events are monitored
        When file system changes occur
        Then events should be properly queued
        And event processing should be throttled
        And duplicate events should be filtered
        And event handlers should be coordinated

    Scenario: Parser Cache Integration
        Given parsed files are cached
        When cached files are accessed
        Then file system reads should be minimized
        And cache invalidation should work
        And memory limits should be respected
        And cache stats should be maintained

    Scenario: Cleanup and Resource Management
        Given parser operations are complete
        When cleanup is triggered
        Then file handles should be released
        And temporary files should be removed
        And watchers should be closed
        And memory should be freed
