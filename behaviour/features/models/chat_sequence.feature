Feature: Chat Sequence Implementation
  As a VS Code extension developer
  I want a ChatSequence structure to group related chat segments
  So that I can maintain the natural flow of conversations

  Background:
    Given the data model system is initialized
    And a valid log file is loaded

  @sequence @smoke
  Scenario: Create new chat sequence from log file
    Given a log file containing multiple "Me" keyword segments
    When a new ChatSequence is created
    Then it should have the following properties:
      | Property      | Type           | Requirement                |
      | id           | string         | unique identifier          |
      | sourceFile   | string         | valid file path           |
      | segments     | array          | non-empty                 |
      | totalSegments| number         | matches segments length   |
      | metadata     | object         | valid metadata object     |

  @sequence @validation
  Scenario: Maintain segment order in sequence
    Given a chat sequence with multiple segments
    When the sequence is populated from the log file
    Then segments should be ordered by "Me" keyword positions
    And each segment should have a sequential order number
    And no segments should be missing from the sequence

  @sequence @memory
  Scenario: Handle large sequences efficiently
    Given a log file with over 1000 chat segments
    When a ChatSequence is created from the file
    Then memory usage should stay within specified limits
    And sequence operations should maintain responsiveness
    And all segments should be properly indexed

  @sequence @integrity
  Scenario: Validate sequence boundaries
    Given a chat sequence with multiple segments
    Then each segment should:
      | Validation                                    |
      | Start with a "Me" keyword                    |
      | End before the next "Me" keyword or EOF      |
      | Have non-overlapping boundaries              |
      | Maintain continuous coverage of the log file |

  @sequence @typing
  Scenario: Ensure type safety
    Given a new ChatSequence instance
    When properties are accessed and modified
    Then TypeScript should enforce:
      | Type Check                               |
      | id is string                            |
      | sourceFile path is valid string         |
      | segments is ChatSegment array           |
      | totalSegments is positive number        |
      | metadata matches ChatSequenceMetadata   |

  @sequence @source
  Scenario Outline: Track source file changes
    Given a chat sequence from file "<filename>"
    When the source file is <action>
    Then the sequence should <result>

    Examples:
      | filename    | action        | result                        |
      | chat.log    | modified      | detect changes and update     |
      | chat.log    | deleted       | mark as orphaned             |
      | chat.log    | renamed       | update source reference       |
      | chat.log    | corrupted     | maintain last valid state    |
