Feature: Data Model Integration
  As a VS Code extension developer
  I want seamless integration between all data model components
  So that I can maintain data consistency and enable efficient operations

  Background:
    Given the data model system is initialized
    And all data structures are properly configured

  @integration @parsing
  Scenario: Integrate "Me" keyword parsing
    Given a log file with multiple "Me" keywords
    When the parser processes the file
    Then it should:
      | Integration Check                            |
      | Create appropriate sequences                 |
      | Generate correct segments                    |
      | Maintain boundary integrity                  |
      | Populate all metadata correctly              |

  @integration @boundaries
  Scenario: Manage segment boundaries
    Given multiple adjacent chat segments
    When boundaries are processed
    Then the system should:
      | Boundary Management                          |
      | Maintain correct "Me" keyword positions      |
      | Prevent overlapping segments                 |
      | Handle edge cases properly                   |
      | Update affected metadata                     |

  @integration @changes
  Scenario: Track data model changes
    Given an existing chat sequence with segments
    When changes occur in <component>
    Then the system should:
      | Change Tracking                              |
      | Log the change details                       |
      | Update dependent components                  |
      | Maintain data consistency                    |
      | Trigger appropriate events                   |

    Examples:
      | component          |
      | source file       |
      | sequence metadata |
      | segment content   |
      | segment boundaries|

  @integration @events
  Scenario: Handle data update events
    Given integrated data model components
    When a data update occurs
    Then the system should:
      | Event Handling                               |
      | Fire appropriate update events               |
      | Maintain event order                         |
      | Update all dependent components              |
      | Preserve data consistency                    |

  @integration @migration
  Scenario: Perform data migrations
    Given a change in data model structure
    When migration is required
    Then the system should:
      | Migration Check                              |
      | Preserve all segment data                    |
      | Maintain boundary integrity                  |
      | Update metadata appropriately                |
      | Validate migrated data                       |

  @integration @performance
  Scenario: Monitor integration performance
    Given a complex data model operation
    When the operation is executed
    Then the system should:
      | Performance Check                            |
      | Complete within time limits                  |
      | Stay within memory bounds                    |
      | Maintain responsiveness                      |
      | Scale with data size                        |

  @integration @integrity
  Scenario: Verify data integrity
    Given integrated data model components
    When integrity checks are performed
    Then the system should verify:
      | Integrity Check                              |
      | All "Me" keyword boundaries                  |
      | Sequence-segment relationships               |
      | Metadata consistency                         |
      | Type safety across components                |
