Feature: WebView Panel Implementation
  As a VS Code user
  I want a custom WebView panel for chat visualization
  So that I can read and interact with chat conversations in a user-friendly interface

  Background:
    Given VS Code is running
    And the BrowseChat extension is activated

  @webview @smoke
  Scenario: Render WebView panel
    When I open a chat log file
    Then the WebView panel should:
      | Requirement                              |
      | Render within 100ms                      |
      | Stay under 50MB memory usage             |
      | Match current VS Code theme              |
      | Display chat content correctly           |
      | Show appropriate loading indicators      |

  @webview @theme
  Scenario: Handle theme changes
    Given the WebView panel is open
    When VS Code theme changes to <theme>
    Then the WebView should update its appearance to match
    And maintain consistent styling for:
      | UI Element        |
      | Background       |
      | Text colors      |
      | Icons            |
      | Borders          |

    Examples:
      | theme    |
      | light    |
      | dark     |
      | high-contrast |

  @webview @memory
  Scenario: Manage memory usage
    Given a large chat log file
    When the WebView renders the content
    Then memory usage should:
      | Memory Check                              |
      | Stay under 50MB limit                     |
      | Release unused resources                  |
      | Handle memory pressure gracefully         |
      | Maintain performance under load           |

  @webview @persistence
  Scenario: Persist WebView state
    Given the WebView panel has active content
    When VS Code is restarted
    Then the WebView should:
      | State Check                               |
      | Restore previous content                  |
      | Maintain scroll position                  |
      | Preserve user interactions                |
      | Resume from last known state              |

  @webview @debug
  Scenario: Enable debugging capabilities
    Given the WebView panel is in debug mode
    Then Chrome DevTools should:
      | Debug Feature                             |
      | Allow element inspection                  |
      | Enable console access                     |
      | Provide network monitoring                |
      | Support breakpoint debugging              |

  @webview @performance
  Scenario: Handle large chat segments
    Given a chat log with segments > 1MB
    When the content is rendered
    Then the WebView should:
      | Performance Check                         |
      | Maintain 100ms render target              |
      | Implement progressive loading             |
      | Show loading indicators                   |
      | Remain responsive to user input           |

  @webview @interaction
  Scenario: Follow VS Code interaction patterns
    Given the WebView panel is active
    Then it should support:
      | Interaction Pattern                       |
      | Standard keyboard shortcuts               |
      | Context menu actions                      |
      | Focus handling                            |
      | Accessibility features                    |
      | Command palette integration               |
